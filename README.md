# RotorHazard-Ready-Up-Plugin
A plugin which allows your RotorHazard lap timer to connect to the BoxOProps [Ready Up Buttons](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1668669369/rotorhazard-ready-up-button). Once all pilots have pressed their ready up button your race can be started automatically! No more shouting at pilots for thumbs up. The ready up buttons also help spectators put names to faces via a bright ring of adressable LEDs which indicate pilot colors and celebrate race winners at the end of each heat. The buttons also enable other useful functionality such as providing pilots an official way to raise a challanges during racing (video stomping: it happens). RotorHazard's built in voice callouts are used throughout to keep the race director and pilots informed on how race staging is commencing.

## User Interface
### Settings Tab
You can find all the settings for the plugin under the Ready Up accordion in RotorHazard's Settings tab
- Require Track Clear: This setting specifies if the track must be marked as clear before automatic race countdown begins
- Pre-Staging Countdown: This setting specifies how many seconds in the future the heat should be scheduled for once all pilots have readied up. This gives the last pilot to ready up a couple extra seconds to get settled
### Run Tab
You can view and update the ready state of each pilot under the Ready Up accordion in RotorHazard's Run tab. You can also view and update whether or not the track is clear
- Track Clear: This marks weather the track is cleared for racing or not. Clearing the track signifies that racing can commence once pilots are ready. If the track is not clear, racing will not commence (assuming Require Track Clear options is enabled). Whoop pilots may want to disable the Require Track Clear defined in the Settings Tab. Outdoor races should keep Require Track Clear enabled for safety purposes. 
- Pilot N Ready: This is a visual indication of which pilots are ready. The number (N) referes to the seat number.
